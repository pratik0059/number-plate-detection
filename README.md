# number-plate-detection
Developed an automated system using Python and OpenCV to detect vehicle number plates from images. The system applies image preprocessing, edge detection, and contour analysis to locate plates, followed by Haar Cascade classifiers for accurate recognition. Enables real-time detection for traffic and security applications.
